## About
The Makeup Community is a review-first web app where users browse real makeup products and read/write honest reviews. It focuses on authenticity, clean design, and a friendly community experience.

- Discover trending products with real images
- Browse products and view consolidated details and reviews
- Create an account to write, edit, and delete your own reviews
- Profile page to see all your reviews

I built this to create a reliable place to research makeup with genuine community feedback.

Local setup:
